An alternative method to using upgrade from the default CPAN shell is to use cpanminus and cpan-outdated.

These are so easy & nimble to use that I hardly ever go back to CPAN shell. To upgrade all your modules in one go is:

cpan-outdated -p | cpanm


I recommend you install cpanminus like the docs describe:

curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus

And then install cpan-outdated along with all other CPAN modules using cpanm:

cpanm App::cpanoutdated

BTW: If you are using perlbrew then you will need to repeat this for every Perl you have installed under it.
